## Align with Key Messages

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book.

## What’s in it for Me?

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Focus Content

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
old.

- Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
  looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
  passage,
- and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered
  the undoubtable source.

## Support Transactions

Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

- This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
- very popular during the Renaissance.

## Use Clear Calls to Action

The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
reproduced below for those interested.

## Write Readably

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are
also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions
from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

## Remove Graphics

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

## Support Skimming

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
sites still in their infancy.

### Paragraphs

arious versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
purpose (injected humour and the like).

### Lists

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority
have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words
which don't look even slightly believable.

### Headings

If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there
isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.

- (h1) Title of Page
- (h2) A Main Idea
- (h3) More info about the h2
- (h4) More info about the h3
- (h2) Another Main Idea

## Use Consistent Web Style

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks
as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

## Be Accessible

The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
